The human skull that was recently found in Minnesota was not called a fossil, maybe because it was only 8,000 years old.

A: Because they have nine lives!\nRosey: Many video games let you have another chance to keep going if you make a really bad mistake, maybe even getting your character killed. (Other games do not give you another life in the same game, and you have to start over.) I am reminded of the classic video game Pac-Man where you would get three lives.

A: One is a cat copy and the other is a copycat!\nRosey: Sometimes in English, brand names become verbs or nouns. For most people, all facial tissue is Kleenex, all internet searches are Googling, and all bandages are Band-Aids. (The term for this is anthimeria.)

In this case, \u201cHe got [sentenced to] 12 months\u201d means that he will spend 12 months in jail.

When a baseball player hits a baseball and it goes up in the air to the outfield we say, \u201cthe baseball player has hit a fly ball,\u201d that is, the player hit the ball and it flew through the air.

High notes are the ones more to the right on a piano; in science the larger the Hz the higher the note. But high notes are not up high; that\u2019s why this joke is funny!", "metadata": {"source": "unified_joke_explanations"}}
{"text": "<human>: Why is this joke funny? Q: What gets wetter the more it dries? A: A towel!\nRosey: A towel is used to dry something like a plate or your hands. As the towel dries your hands the towel, which was dry, becomes wet. It is not the towel that is becoming dry, it is your hands that are becoming dry. This joke is funny because it plays on the opposites of wet and dry. How could something get wet as it dries?", "metadata": {"source": "unified_joke_explanations"}}
{"text": "<human>: Knock, knock! Who\u2019s There?\nAsh.\nAsh who?\nBless you! Why is this joke funny?\nRosey: Ash who? Sounds like \u201cAchoo!\u201d \u201cAchoo\u201d is how the sound of a sneeze is written in English in the United States. So when the asker asks \u201cAsh who?\u201d it sounds like Achoo! And if someone sneezes you say \u201cBless you!\u201d", "metadata": {"source": "unified_joke_explanations"}}
{"text": "<human>: I'm going to give you a joke. After I give you the joke, please explain it: Q: Why did Cinderella get kicked off the soccer team? A: Because she ran away from the ball!\nRosey: Cinderella went to that fancy dance party in her fancy dress. That fancy dance party is called \u201ca ball.\u201d So is the sphere that soccer players kick- a ball. This joke plays on the word \u201cball.\u201d And soccer players can\u2019t run away from the ball!", "metadata": {"source": "unified_joke_explanations"}}
{"text": "<human>: Q: What did the 0 say to the 8? A: Nice belt! Why is this joke funny?\nRosey: The number zero sees an eight and thinks it is just like me, a zero, so it must have a belt. Numbers thinking crazy thoughts!", "metadata": {"source": "unified_joke_explanations"}}
{"text": "<human>: I'm going to give you a joke. After I give you the joke, please explain it: Q: Why was 6 afraid of 7? A: Because 7, 8, 9!\nRosey: If you read the numbers is sounds like seven-eight (ate)-nine. And if I were 6, I, too, would be afraid of seven if it is eating other numbers, such as nine! Seven ate the nine!", "metadata": {"source": "unified_joke_explanations"}}
{"text": "<human>: Q: Why did the child study in the airplane? A: He wanted a higher education! Why is this joke funny?\nRosey: Higher education: that means studies beyond high school such as going to the university. Higher education does not refer to altitude, like studying while high in the sky; that\u2019s why it\u2019s funny.", "metadata": {"source": "unified_joke_explanations"}}
{"text": "<human>: Q. What do you get when you cross a snowman with a vampire? A. Frostbite. Why is this joke funny?\nRosey: This is a common type of joke that is funny because you cross (combine) one thing with another (usually two things that do not go together). In this case a snowman (like Frosty the Snowman?) with a vampire (that bites people). Funny! Click this link to learn more about Frostbite. Frost is the ice that is formed on the ground when the temperature goes below freezing.", "metadata": {"source": "unified_joke_explanations"}}
{"text": "<human>: I'm going to give you a joke. After I give you the joke, please explain it: Q. What did the grape do when it got stepped on? A. It let out a little wine!\nRosey: Wine is made from grapes. Traditionally (that is, a long time ago), grapes were \u201cpressed\u201d by stepping them ( did you see the scene in A Walk in the Clouds?) to get the juice out. \u201cWhine,\u201d which sounds the same as \u201cwine,\u201d means to complain a little bit about something. A child might whine about having to eat something he or she doesn\u2019t like; you might whine if someone stepped on you, kind of like the grapes in the joke.", "metadata": {"source": "unified_joke_explanations"}}
{"text": "<human>: Why is this joke funny? Q. Why don\u2019t skeletons fight each other? A. They don\u2019t have the guts.\nRosey: To \u201chave guts\u201d is to be brave. If you \u201cdon\u2019t have the guts\u201d to do something it means you are scared to do it. \u201cGuts\u201d are your innards, your internal organs (heart, lung, liver, \u2026). This joke plays on the idea that skeletons don\u2019t have guts (they are nothing but bones so they have no internal organs), or are they scared. The double meaning of the word \u201cguts\u201d makes this joke funny.", "metadata": {"source": "unified_joke_explanations"}}
{"text": "<human>: I'm going to give you a joke. After I give you the joke, please explain it: Q: What did the water say to the boat? A: Nothing, it just waved.\nRosey: \u201cWave\u201d is what you do when you move your hand as if saying hello. \u201cWave\u201d is also the name for a way the top of the water moves: the raised part of the water that moves toward the shore is a wave. This joke plays on the word \u201cwave\u201d and is funny because the water waves (as if saying hello) while the water has waves (the raised part of the water).", "metadata": {"source": "unified_joke_explanations"}}
{"text": "<human>: Why is this joke funny? Q. Why do sea-gulls fly over the sea? A. Because if they flew over the bay they would be bagels!\nRosey: This joke plays on the words seagull (a bird) and bagel (a round bread shaped like a donut). There is no such thing as a bay gull but there is a bagel and both sound the same- that\u2019s why it is funny!", "metadata": {"source": "unified_joke_explanations"}}
{"text": "<human>: Explain this joke: Q: What is black and white and red all over? A: A newspaper!\nRosey: This joke plays on the word red/ read. \u201cRed\u201d is a color, like black and white. \u201cRead\u201d(pronounced \u201cred\u201d) is the past tense of read (every day I read, yesterday I read). When your brain hears red after hearing black and white it assumes that the speaker is talking about colors. In this case the speaker is talking about the past tense verb read. A newspaper is black because of the ink and white because of the paper. It is read all over because you can read it anywhere in the world. Funny!", "metadata": {"source": "unified_joke_explanations"}}
{"text": "<human>: Explain this joke: Q: Why was the broom late? A: It over swept!\nRosey: Brooms are for sweeping; one reason that people are late is because they over sleep. \u201cSleep\u201d in the past tense is \u201cslept\u201d (everyday I sleep, yesterday I slept). \u201cSlept\u201d rhymes with swept (swept is sweep in the past tense- everyday I sweep, yesterday I swept). This joke is funny because the expected answer is \u201cIt over slept\u201d not its rhyme, \u201cIt over swept.\u201d", "metadata": {"source": "unified_joke_explanations"}}
{"text": "<human>: Q: How does a Snowman get to work? A: By icicle. Explain this joke.\nRosey: I'll try my best. Take a look at the answer- by icicle. If you say the two words quickly you get the word bicycle. An icicle is ice that is formed by dripping water, like ice that hangs off a roof in the winter. Again, here the funny part is playing with the words \u201cby icicle\u201d and \u201cbicycle.\u201d", "metadata": {"source": "unified_joke_explanations"}}
{"text": "<human>: Explain this joke: Q: Where does a snowman keep his money? A: In a snow bank.\nRosey: This joke plays on the word \u201cbank\u201d. A bank is a place where people keep their money; a snowbank is a pile of snow (which is not a good place to keep money!).", "metadata": {"source": "unified_joke_explanations"}}
{"text": "<human>: Q.What runs around a soccer field but doesn\u2019t move? A:A fence Explain this joke.\nRosey: I'll try my best. This joke plays on the word \u201cruns\u201d: A person runs; a fence runs around, that is, goes around, an area like a soccer field.", "metadata": {"source": "unified_joke_explanations"}}
{"text": "<human>: I'm going to give you a joke. After I give you the joke, please explain it: Knock, knock.\nWho\u2019s there?\nLettuce.\nLettuce who?\nLettuce in and you\u2019ll find out!\nRosey: Knock-knock jokes play with words: words that sound the same but are different or words that have more than one meaning. In this joke the jokester is playing with the words \u201clet us\u201d and \u201clettuce.\u201d It is funny because the listener assumes the word is lettuce.", "metadata": {"source": "unified_joke_explanations"}}
{"text": "<human>: Q:Why did the chicken cross the road? A:To get to the other side. Explain this joke.\nRosey: I'll try my best. The answer to this joke (\u201cTo get to the other side\u201d) is so obvious, something everyone knows, that it is funny because it is silly, perhaps even stupid. Why else would you cross a road except to get to the other side?", "metadata": {"source": "unified_joke_explanations"}}
